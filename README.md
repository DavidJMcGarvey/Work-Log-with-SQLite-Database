This Work Log program collects information from a user/employee regarding

Terminal or Console CLI.

**Notice:** This project uses the third party package **pipenv**. Trouble 
running this program may be due to this package not existing on your own 
system. Sorry for the inconvenience, future me will know how to deal with this 
problem in a better manner than this disclaimer :)
